# Beast tamers

An attempt to make a digital version of one of my boardgame designs.

Also trying to figure out some javascript stuff like React, Falcor and Flux.

Requirements: 

  - latest version of nodejs
  - npm

Running:

  ```npm install```
  
  ```npm start```

Now the game should be available at http://localhost:3000
